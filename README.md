# 2-CHINESE VOCAB
 This is a script in MATLAB that uses psychtoolbox functionalities as to present a list of words organized by grammatical category. Overall these categories contain the 5000+ more frequent word in Chinese language. The script can be modified in several ways including a) the targeted language, which can be set to be English, Spanish or Japanese; b) the colors of both fonts and background; c) the system voice as well as the speed; and d) three different presentation modes according to your preference. You may also want to change the pictures displayed as background, the collection of pictures presented here depict different spots in Tainan city â€“ Taiwan.  Some samples of how the visualization looks can be watch in this youtube channel. I just simply recorded my screen while the program was running, but as to include some adornments to the videos I also added as background some binaural and Alpha waves songs which are told to improve concentration and memory when studying.
